## Automate Tailscale with Terraform

This Terraform project provisions an AWS EC2 instance configured as a Tailscale exit node, along with all necessary networking infrastructure (VPC, subnets, security groups, etc.).

### Prerequisites
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) >= 1.0 installed
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) configured with appropriate credentials
- An AWS account with permissions to create VPC, EC2, and networking resources
- A [Tailscale account](https://login.tailscale.com/start)
- SSH key pair generated locally

### 🚀 Getting Started

#### Step 1: Generate SSH Key Pair

If you don't already have an SSH key pair:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/web_key
```

This creates:
- `~/.ssh/web_key` (private key)
- `~/.ssh/web_key.pub` (public key)

#### Step 2: Get Tailscale Auth Key

1. Go to [Tailscale Admin Console](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/keys)
2. Click **Generate auth key**
3. Configure the key:
    - ✅ **Reusable** (if you plan to recreate the instance)
    - ✅ **Ephemeral** (optional - removes device when disconnected)
    - Set expiration as needed
4. Copy the generated key (starts with `tskey-auth-`)

#### Step 3: Initialize Terraform

```bash
terraform init
```

#### Step 4: Review the Plan

```bash
terraform plan
```

Review the resources that will be created.

#### Step 5: Apply the Configuration

```bash
terraform apply
```

Type `yes` when prompted to confirm.

#### Step 6: Enable Exit Node in Tailscale

1. Go to [Tailscale Admin Console](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines)
2. Find your new device (named after the instance)
3. Click the **⋮** menu next to the device
4. Select **Edit route settings**
5. Enable **Use as exit node**

### Connecting to Your Instance

#### Via SSH

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/web_key ubuntu@<public_ip>
```

#### Check Tailscale Status

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/web_key ubuntu@<public_ip> 'sudo tailscale status'
```

### 🌐 Using the Exit Node

On your Tailscale client devices:

### macOS/Linux/Windows
```bash
tailscale up --exit-node=<device-name>
```

### Cleanup

To destroy all resources:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

Type `yes` when prompted. This will:
1. Terminate the EC2 instance
2. Delete all networking components
3. Release the Elastic IP
4. Remove all created resources

**Note:** Your Tailscale device will remain in the admin console but will show as offline.
